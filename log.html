          To be honest, I don’t know. As designers and artists, we are always looking for some inspiration, which could be anything. Not just visual elements, it’s actually limitless. Let’s say, a phrase.</p>

          <h1>The ocean remembers for 200 years.</h1>
          <p>This poetic statement comes from the marine scientist immediately sparking in our mind, ends up being the highlight for our first discussion.
“Well, Weather forgets everything.” Clemens said to me when he heard it. He is a researcher of climate, and a great person to work with.
If the weather can forget its change, I assume that the earth can forget humans as well. I have once seen an interview with a Chinese geologist; He was irritated by the journalist so he threw a straight ball:” Stopping climate change is not about saving the earth, it’s about saving ourselves. The earth exists with or without human, in the past and most likely in the future.”
Although, to me, scientists are more devoted to passively observation instead of actively bringing changes. Some large scale geoengineering ideas had been advocated but never executed. Clemens explains to me how unpredictable consequences these radical measurements can bring, without the promise to be good. We are not clever enough to do so, I said. He can’t disagree, I know.

            <p>So don’t expect to fix the problem by a hammer strike. Despite the disappointment of climate politics, Clemens thinks we already have enough knowledge to stop climate change. It’s on us, human beings, not on the professionals.
In my opinion, systems as big as climate are always too large for a single human to care about. In fact, there was a group of fish ought to move up north for 2 degrees of latitude because of climate change. Can you imagine? I can’t. You’re not a fish, what do you know? That’s what an ancient Chinese philosophy had said.
But if you scale the fish to human size, this 2 degrees means more than a thousand kilometers. Imagine if you have to move from Norway to Iceland by foot. Not to say fishes there all speak weird dialect to you. Isn’t that crazy?</p>

But if the message behind can be delivered because of it, then it’s not what we should be afraid of. Looking for different representations is not irrelevant, it’s for the audience, it’s rephrasing the truth.</span></p>
